## Common Dealer Objections & Responses

### Objection 1: "I don't have painters"

**Response:**
> "You don't need to hire painters. Birla Opus has 3 lakh+ registered painters through Birla Opus ID program. We'll help you connect with trained painters in your area. They work on project basis - you pay them per job, no fixed salary."

### Objection 2: "Managing service is complicated"

**Response:**
> "We've simplified it. You quote the customer, assign a painter, and oversee completion. Birla Opus provides quote templates, process checklists, and technical support. Most dealers get comfortable after 2-3 jobs."

### Objection 3: "What if quality is poor and customer complains?"

**Response:**
> "That's why we have Birla Opus trained painters and quality process. We provide a checklist for each job. Plus, Birla Opus backs the service with workmanship warranty. If there's an issue, we support you in resolving it."

### Objection 4: "I don't have time for this"

**Response:**
> "Start with just 1-2 jobs. Your existing staff can handle it. Once you see the revenue, you might want to dedicate someone. One successful job takes 5-6 days but earns Rs. 10,000+. What's your margin on selling 5 cans of paint?"

### Objection 5: "My customers just want to buy paint"

**Response:**
> "Some do. But many ask 'do you know a good painter?' You're sending them elsewhere and losing that revenue. With PaintCraft, you capture the complete customer spend."

### Objection 6: "Competition offers painting services too"

**Response:**
> "Exactly why you should too. Don't let customers go elsewhere. With Birla Opus, you have quality products + trained painters + brand trust. That's your competitive advantage."

### Price Justification

> "Yes, we may be 10-15% higher than a random painter. But we use premium Birla Opus products with up to 16-year warranty. Our painters are trained. And you have one point of contact for any issues. That peace of mind is worth the small difference."
