## Area Calculation

### Interior Room

**Formula:**
```
Wall Area = (Length + Width) x 2 x Height
```

**Deductions:**
- Standard door: 21 sq ft
- Standard window: 15 sq ft
- Large window: 25 sq ft

**Example: 12 x 10 ft room, 10 ft height**
```
Walls = (12 + 10) x 2 x 10 = 440 sq ft
Minus 1 door = 440 - 21 = 419 sq ft
Minus 2 windows = 419 - 30 = 389 sq ft
Paintable area = ~390 sq ft
```

**Ceiling (if required):**
```
Ceiling = Length x Width = 12 x 10 = 120 sq ft
```

### Exterior Building

**Formula:**
```
Wall Area = Perimeter x Height
```

**Example: 40 x 30 ft building, 30 ft height (3 floors)**
```
Perimeter = (40 + 30) x 2 = 140 ft
Wall area = 140 x 30 = 4,200 sq ft
Minus windows/doors (~15%) = 4,200 - 630 = 3,570 sq ft
```

### Terrace

```
Terrace Area = Length x Width + Parapet walls
Parapet = Perimeter x Parapet height x 2 (both sides)
```

## Common Questions

**Q: How much discount can I give customer?**
A: Keep minimum 15-20% margin on material. Labor rates are already competitive.

**Q: Should I include GST in quote?**
A: Always show GST separately. Total should include GST.

**Q: What if customer asks for cheaper paint?**
A: Explain product benefits. Offer Style range as economy option. Never use non-Birla Opus products in PaintCraft jobs.

**Q: How to handle price negotiation?**
A: Negotiate on labor, not material. Can reduce labor rate for larger areas or repeat customers.
